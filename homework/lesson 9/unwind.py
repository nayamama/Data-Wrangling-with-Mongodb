"""
For this exercise, let's return to our cities infobox dataset. The question we would like you to answer
is as follows:  Which region or district in India contains the most cities? (Make sure that the count of
cities is stored in a field named 'count'; see the assertions at the end of the script.)

As a starting point, use the solution for the example question we looked at -- "Who includes the most
user mentions in their tweets?"

One thing to note about the cities data is that the "isPartOf" field contains an array of regions or
districts in which a given city is found. See the example document in Instructor Comments below.
